# CNN-Pose-Prediction
CNN-based pose prediction for overlaying Augmented Reality Objects

Objective:
Build an Augmented Reality application to detect a QR code in the user's surroundings using the camera frame,
read the data embedded in the QR code, and finally display a pose-accurate 3D model on the QR Code
